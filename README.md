# Feihong's FAKE Quickstart

http://fsharp.github.io/FAKE/

> "FAKE - F# Make" is a build automation system with capabilities which are similar to make and rake. It is using an easy domain-specific language (DSL) so that you can start using it without learning F#. If you need more than the default functionality you can either write F# or simply reference .NET assemblies.
